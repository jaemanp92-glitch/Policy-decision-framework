# Case Study 01 – Borderline Content Assessment

## 🧩 Case Summary
A user-uploaded post contained potentially harmful language that could be interpreted
as either contextual discussion or indirect harassment, depending on intent.

## 📜 Relevant Policy Areas
- Harassment & Hate
- Contextual Threats
- Abusive Conduct (Borderline)

## 🔍 Assessment Process

### 1. Policy Grounding
The content did not explicitly violate policy thresholds for direct threats or hate speech,
but fell into a gray area requiring contextual review.

### 2. Context & Intent Evaluation
- No direct target was clearly identified
- Language appeared metaphorical rather than literal
- User history showed no prior enforcement actions

### 3. Risk Severity Assessment
- Potential for misinterpretation by viewers
- Low likelihood of real-world harm
- Medium contextual sensitivity

### 4. Enforcement Decision
**Action taken:** Allow with monitoring  
**Rationale:** Content did not meet removal threshold, but warranted observation
for potential escalation.

## ⚖️ Trade-offs Considered
- Over-enforcement risk vs. user expression
- Platform safety vs. contextual nuance

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Importance of consistent policy interpretation
- Value of contextual signals in enforcement decisions
- Need for proportional responses in ambiguous cases
