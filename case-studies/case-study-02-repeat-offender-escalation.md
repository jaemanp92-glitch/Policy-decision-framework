# Case Study 02 – Repeat Offender & Escalation Decision

## 🧩 Case Summary
A user with prior enforcement history posted additional borderline content.
While the individual post did not clearly exceed removal thresholds,
the cumulative pattern raised concerns about escalation risk.

## 👤 User History & Context
- Multiple prior warnings issued for similar behavior
- No single severe violation, but repeated borderline conduct
- Engagement volume increasing, indicating wider exposure

## 📜 Relevant Policy Areas
- Repeat Offender Policy
- Progressive Enforcement Guidelines
- Harassment & Abusive Conduct (Borderline)

## 🔍 Assessment Process

### 1. Policy Grounding
- Individual content assessment did not meet removal criteria
- Repeat offender policy allows escalation based on cumulative behavior
- Emphasis on proportional and progressive enforcement

### 2. Pattern & Risk Evaluation
- Frequency of borderline behavior increasing
- Signs of normalization and testing policy boundaries
- Risk of future harm if left unaddressed

### 3. Platform Risk Consideration
- Potential impact on community norms
- Risk of inconsistent enforcement if no action taken
- Importance of early intervention to prevent escalation

## ⚖️ Enforcement Decision
**Action Taken:** Temporary account restriction with formal warning  

**Rationale:**
- Content alone insufficient for removal
- Pattern indicates emerging risk
- Enforcement aimed at behavior correction rather than punishment

## 🔄 Trade-offs Considered
- User retention vs. community safety
- Over-enforcement vs. under-enforcement risk
- Short-term friction vs. long-term platform trust

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Repeat patterns require a different lens than single-content review
- Escalation decisions must balance proportionality and prevention
- Consistency in enforcement strengthens platform credibility
