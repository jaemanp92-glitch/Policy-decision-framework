## 🧩 Case Summary
A user with prior enforcement history continued to post borderline content. While each individual post fell below the removal threshold, the repeated pattern raised concerns about escalation and future harm.

## 👤 User History & Context
- Multiple prior warnings for similar borderline behavior  
- No single severe violation, but a consistent pattern over time  
- Increasing engagement volume, expanding the content’s reach  

## 📜 Relevant Policy Areas
- Repeat Offender Policy  
- Progressive Enforcement Guidelines  
- Harassment & Abusive Conduct (Borderline)  

## 🔍 Assessment Process

### 1. Policy Grounding
On its own, the content did not justify removal under harassment or abuse policies. However, the repeat offender framework allows enforcement decisions to account for cumulative behavior, which became a key consideration in this case.

### 2. Pattern & Risk Evaluation
The frequency of borderline behavior had increased, suggesting the user was gradually pushing enforcement boundaries. While the risk was not immediate, leaving the behavior unaddressed increased the likelihood of escalation over time.

### 3. Platform Risk Consideration
The primary concern was not a single post, but the precedent set by allowing repeated borderline behavior to continue unchecked. Inconsistent responses at this stage could make future enforcement more difficult.

## ⚖️ Enforcement Decision
**Action taken:** Temporary account restriction with a formal warning  

This decision aimed to interrupt the behavioral pattern without immediately escalating to harsher penalties. A stronger action was considered, but was ultimately deemed disproportionate given the absence of a clear removal-level violation.

## 🔄 Trade-offs Considered
- Correcting behavior versus retaining the user  
- Early intervention versus risk of over-enforcement  
- Short-term friction versus long-term enforcement consistency  

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Repeat patterns require a different lens than single-content review  
- Escalation decisions benefit from early, proportionate intervention  
- Consistent enforcement supports long-term platform stability
