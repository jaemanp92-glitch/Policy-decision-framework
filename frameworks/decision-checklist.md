# Trust & Safety Decision Checklist

This checklist outlines a structured approach to evaluating ambiguous or borderline
content in Trust & Safety operations.

---

## 1️⃣ Policy Grounding
- Identify the relevant policy sections
- Confirm explicit violation thresholds
- Note any policy exceptions or carve-outs

## 2️⃣ Context & Intent Assessment
- Who is the target (individual, group, none)
- Literal vs. metaphorical language
- User intent signals (history, pattern, escalation)
- Surrounding conversation or media context

## 3️⃣ Risk Severity Evaluation
- Likelihood of real-world harm
- Potential for misinterpretation
- Scale of exposure (reach, virality)
- Vulnerable populations involved

## 4️⃣ Enforcement Decision
- Remove / Restrict / Label / Allow
- Apply least restrictive action possible
- Document rationale clearly

## 5️⃣ Trade-off Review
- Safety vs. freedom of expression
- Consistency vs. contextual nuance
- Short-term impact vs. long-term risk

## 6️⃣ Post-Decision Actions
- Monitoring or follow-up actions
- Signals for re-evaluation
- Feedback loop into policy refinement

## 🧠 Why this matters
Consistent decision-making frameworks reduce enforcement bias,
improve reviewer alignment, and strengthen platform trust.
