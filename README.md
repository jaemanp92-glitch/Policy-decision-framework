## 📌 Overview
This repository brings together Trust & Safety case studies based on real moderation and policy enforcement scenarios. It focuses on how decisions are made when policy guidance is clear in principle but ambiguous in practice.

## 🎯 Purpose
I created this repository to show how I approach borderline or ambiguous content cases, especially in situations where policy language alone does not fully resolve the decision and judgment is required.

## 🧠 Decision Framework
Each case follows a consistent decision flow that reflects how I balance policy consistency with real-world risk and enforcement proportionality:

1. Policy grounding – identifying what the policy clearly states and where interpretation is required  
2. Context and intent evaluation – reviewing user behavior, surrounding signals, and historical patterns  
3. Risk severity assessment – assessing potential harm, scale, and likelihood  
4. Enforcement outcome selection – choosing actions that are proportionate and consistent

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/case-studies` – Individual Trust & Safety cases with decision reasoning and outcomes  
- `/frameworks` – Decision-making models and checklists used to maintain consistency across edge cases  

## 🔍 What this shows
- How policy is interpreted when guidance is unclear or conflicting  
- How enforcement decisions are reasoned and documented  
- How operational judgment is applied in Trust & Safety environments
